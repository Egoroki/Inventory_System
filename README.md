# Inventory System

The designed application consists of two parts â€“ client side and server side, so it comes in two files: "Server.jar" and "Client.jar". Also, to run these files, it needed the included "lib" folder with necessary libraries for the application and the "demo.properties" file, which stores the database parameters for the server part

The application can be launched from the Windows command line by entering the "java -jar Server.jar" command for the server part of the application and then "java -jar Client.jar" for the client
